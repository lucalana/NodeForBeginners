# Chapter 2

There are a lot of differents ways to install node in your machine you can download the binaries  
from the official website, build from source and etc, but for me the best way is use a nvm(node version
manager) with nvm you can install and use different versions for different project, it is up to you.

[NVM github](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)

And you can use node directly on the browser you just need to open the console and write your code.
